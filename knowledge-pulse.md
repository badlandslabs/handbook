## Pattern Log

| Pattern | Description | Supporting Idea IDs | Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| L0–L5 Autonomy Taxonomy | Inspired by SAE J3016 automotive standards; the dividing line is L2 vs L3 (pre-action approval vs post-action audit). Production ceiling is L3–L4. L5 is explicitly unsafe for enterprise across CSA, ASDLC, Zylos, and SAE frameworks. | I-002 | Critical convergence: all independent frameworks agree on the same levels. |
| Bounded Autonomy | Agents get wide latitude within enforceable fences; escalation is mandatory at defined boundaries. The absence of an explicit level is not L0 — it is "whatever the agent can get away with." | I-002 | L3+ requires undo stack + governance agent overlay. |
| Read-to-Write Escalation Gate | The transition from reading information to modifying external systems is the single most actionable governance heuristic. Confirmed across CSA, Zylos, and Vitalora. Every escalation taxonomy converges here. | I-002 | This is a technical gate (function), not a policy document. |
| Governance Agent Overlay | For L4+ multi-agent systems: a dedicated rule-engine (not LLM) monitors agents, detects policy violations, and can autonomously demote privileges. Governance agent is deterministic — no LLM in the enforcement path. | I-002 | Sourced from CSA v2.0 + Zylos. Prevents circular LLM dependency. |
| Three-Layer Key Model | Intent key / Execution key / Compensation key — each encodes a different phase and survives agent restarts. | I-001 | Deterministic hashing from action metadata (not UUIDs) so any process can find and operate. |
| Three-Layer Temporal Decomposition | Strategic (months) → Tactical (days) → Operational (minutes) layers separate intent from execution. The worker never re-derives intent — it reads tactical context from memory. 3.5x completion improvement (15.2% vs 4.3% baseline). CORPGEN from Zylos. | I-003 | Planner fires 2x max per session: initial decompose + replan-on-failure. Calling planner every step is the #1 anti-pattern. |
| Planner-Worker Cost Asymmetry | Capable model (Sonnet-4/o4) = ~5% of calls (planning); cheap model (Haiku/Llama 8B) = ~95% (execution). Up to 90% cost reduction vs single-agent. Split is about call frequency, not model quality. | I-003 | Architecture pays for planning overhead by making execution cheap. Pairs with compensation keys (I-001) for recovery. |
| Governance Decay | Context compaction (summarization/eviction) silently erases in-context safety constraints — violation rates jump from 0% to 30–59% without model or prompt changes. Compaction optimizes for task continuity, not constraint preservation. Defense: Constraint Pinning (~47 pinned tokens restores 0% violations). | I-004 | Chen, arXiv:2606.22528 (27 Jun 2026). The same mechanism that prevents context overflow also destroys safety guarantees. |
| Phase-State Machines | Action records need explicit lifecycle states (PENDING → COMMITTED → COMPENSATING → COMPENSATED) to survive distributed retries and multi-agent handoffs. | I-001 | Analogous to saga pattern in distributed transactions. |
| Blast Radius Isolation | Compensation actions must themselves be idempotent. Using the compensation key as the idempotency key for the reversal prevents double-credit. | I-001 | Confirmed via Cordum's production guide. |

## Recent Decisions

| Run Date | Idea ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-07-02 | I-004 | WRITTEN — S-360 | Governance Decay (context compaction silently erases safety constraints) — completely uncovered in the handbook. arXiv:2606.22528 (Chen, 27 Jun 2026) just published. Violation rates jump 0%→59% with no model/prompt changes. The same compaction systems teams deploy to avoid context overflow are simultaneously destroying safety guarantees. Directly related to S-355 (bounded autonomy — L3+ agents are highest risk), S-198 (tool-call guardrails — enforcement downstream of where decay happens). |
| 2026-07-02 | I-005 | WRITTEN — S-362 | Budget-Aware Agents (cost as first-class behavioral dimension) — gap: cost observability (s322, s346, f192) is covered but budget-embedded agent behavior is not. Key pattern: 3-mode cost system (full→conservative→terminate) at 50%/80% budget thresholds, cost tracker injection into context, cost-aware tool selection. Timely: AgentMarketCap (Apr 2026) shows 40–60% cost reduction via budget-aware design; Orq.ai FinOps (Jun 2026) on cost-per-outcome KPIs. NOT covered by s346 (token cost trap — focuses on multiplicative compounding economics) or f192 (cost velocity circuit breaker — reactive, not behavioral). |
| 2026-07-02 | I-001 | WRITTEN — S-352 | Compensation keys (distinct from idempotency keys) cover the layer above: reversing correctly-executed wrong-intent actions. All existing entries (S-93, S-181, F-107) cover prevention/deduplication — none cover autonomous reversal. Gap confirmed by Cordum, AgentMag, and early GitHub discussions on agentic compensation. |
| 2026-07-02 | I-003 | WRITTEN — S-357 | Long-Running Agent Orchestration (Planner-Worker, CORPGEN three-layer temporal decomposition). Completely uncovered in handbook — zero entries on task decomposition, planner-worker, or strategic/tactical/operational layer separation. 3.5x completion improvement and 90% cost reduction are concrete and verifiable. Runner-up: Synthetic Data Pipelines (R-13 covers research angle, stacks thin but not a gap), Constitutional Guardrails (S-349 already covers four-layer enforcement). |
